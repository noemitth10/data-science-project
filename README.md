# Data Science Project

My topic for this course is fake news detection. 

I will use the fake news dataset of the University of Victoria.
https://www.uvic.ca/ecs/ece/isot/datasets/fake-news/index.php

The dataset contains four columns: title, text, subject, date.

With this dataset my goal is to train a neural network model to detect fake news with a high accuracy.
